# JavaScript Practice

This repo was created for me to store my codes whenever I feel like trying new random knowledge on JavaScript.

Definitely, from time to time, I will be pushing new commits to this repo, with proper comments to help you understand the logic for each js file.

Thanks for stopping by!
