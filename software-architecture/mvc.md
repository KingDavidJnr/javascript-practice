Example of a folder structure for Gigslance backend using the MVC architectural pattern:

```
- app.js (Entry point)
- controllers/
  - userController.js
  - gigController.js
  - paymentController.js
  - reviewController.js
  ...
- models/
  - userModel.js
  - gigModel.js
  - paymentModel.js
  - reviewModel.js
  ...
- views/ (Not applicable for a backend API)
- routes/
  - userRoutes.js
  - gigRoutes.js
  - paymentRoutes.js
  - reviewRoutes.js
  ...
- middleware/
  - authMiddleware.js
  - validationMiddleware.js
  ...
- services/
  - userService.js
  - gigService.js
  - paymentService.js
  - reviewService.js
  ...
- config/
  - database.js
  - auth.js
  ...
- utils/
  - commonUtils.js
  - validationUtils.js
  ...
- tests/ (Optional, for tests)
  - userController.test.js
  - gigController.test.js
  - paymentController.test.js
  - reviewController.test.js
  ...
```

In this folder structure:

- The `controllers` directory contains controller files responsible for handling requests, interacting with models and services, and returning responses.
- The `models` directory holds the model files that define the data structures and handle interactions with the database.
- The `views` directory is not applicable for a backend API, as it is typically used in a server-side rendering scenario.
- The `routes` directory contains route files that define the API routes and map them to the appropriate controller methods.
- The `middleware` directory includes custom middleware functions for handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, validation, logging, etc.
- The `services` directory contains service files that encapsulate complex business logic or interactions with external services.
- The `config` directory holds configuration files, such as database configuration or authentication settings.
- The `utils` directory includes utility functions that can be shared across different parts of the codebase.
- The `tests` directory is optional and contains test files for testing the controllers, models, or other components of the backend.

This is just a suggested structure, and you can adapt it based on the specific needs and requirements of the Gigslance backend.
