Example of a folder structure for Gigslance backend using a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):

```
- app.js (Entry point)
- services/
  - userService/
    - userController.js
    - userModel.js
    - userRepository.js
    - userValidation.js
    - ...
  - gigService/
    - gigController.js
    - gigModel.js
    - gigRepository.js
    - gigValidation.js
    - ...
  - paymentService/
    - paymentController.js
    - paymentModel.js
    - paymentRepository.js
    - paymentValidation.js
    - ...
  - reviewService/
    - reviewController.js
    - reviewModel.js
    - reviewRepository.js
    - reviewValidation.js
    - ...
- config/
  - database.js
  - auth.js
  ...
- middleware/
  - authMiddleware.js
  - validationMiddleware.js
  ...
- utils/
  - commonUtils.js
  - validationUtils.js
  ...
- tests/ (Optional, for tests)
  - userService.test.js
  - gigService.test.js
  - paymentService.test.js
  - reviewService.test.js
  ...
```

In this folder structure:

- The `services` directory contains subdirectories for each service in your Gigslance system. Each service directory includes files related to that specific service, such as controllers, models, repositories, validations, and other necessary files.
- The `config` directory holds configuration files for the entire system, such as database configuration, authentication settings, and other global configurations.
- The `middleware` directory contains middleware functions that can be used by multiple services for handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, validation, logging, etc.
- The `utils` directory includes utility functions that can be shared across different parts of the codebase.
- The `tests` directory is optional and contains test files for testing the services, controllers, models, or other components of the backend.

This structure follows the SOA principle of organizing the codebase based on services. Each service is self-contained within its own directory, making it easier to maintain and understand the codebase. You can further expand each service directory based on your specific needs, such as adding subdirectories for routes, middleware, or additional modules.

NB: This is just a suggested structure, and you can customize it based on the requirements and organization of the Gigslance backend using the Service-Oriented Architecture approach.
