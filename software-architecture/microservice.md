In this folder structure:

- Each microservice (e.g., `user-service`, `gig-service`, `payment-service`, `review-service`) is organized within its own directory. Each microservice follows a similar structure with folders for controllers, models, routes, services, config, and tests.
- The `app.js` file within each microservice initializes and configures the microservice, including setting up routes and middleware.
- The `controllers` directory contains the controller files responsible for handling requests and orchestrating interactions between the models and services.
- The `models` directory holds the model files that define the data structures and handle interactions with the database specific to each microservice.
- The `routes` directory includes route files that define the API routes for each microservice.
- The `services` directory contains the service files that encapsulate the business logic and handle interactions with the models within each microservice.
- The `config` directory holds configuration files specific to each microservice, such as database configuration.
- The `tests` directory includes test files for testing the controllers and services within each microservice.
- The `shared` directory includes shared code or utilities that can be used across multiple microservices, such as common utilities or middleware functions.
- The `tests` directory includes subdirectories for integration tests (`integration/`) and end-to-end tests (`e2e/`) that can be used to test the interactions between the microservices.

This structure represents an example of organizing the codebase based on Microservices.
